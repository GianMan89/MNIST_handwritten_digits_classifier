I chose to normalize the data because it ensures that each input parameter (pixel, in this case) has a similar data distribution. This makes convergence faster while training the network. Here, I applied the mean and standard deviation of the MNIST training set given in https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/normalization-in-the-mnist-example/457. In addition, I applied random rotation and translation to the training set to increase the number of training examples and to make the model more robust to these transformations. For the test set, I only applied normalization to see how the model performs on the original test set without any augmentation."
